- Feedbin (official or self-hosted)

Other key features include:

- A dedicated subscriptions tab organized by latest updates with article titles.
- Search for local articles or filter by read status.
- Organize subscriptions with groups.
- Support for two-pane view and multitasking on iPad and Android tablets.

The following features from the desktop app are **NOT** present:

- Local RSS support and source / group management.
- Importing or exporting OPML files, full application data backup & restoration.

- Fetch articles in the background and send push notifications.
- Keyboard shortcuts.

## Development

```shell
% flutter clean
% flutter gen-l10n
% flutter run
```

You don't need an l10n.yaml file because defaults are used (generated files in ignored .dart_tool directory)
